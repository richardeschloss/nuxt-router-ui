A router UI for Vue based on d3. Basically a wrapper around the D3Tree that would feed it `window.$router.options.routes`

* Feed the tree with the routes
* The tree should still look good in the modal 
* If route requires parameters, launch dialog box to grab the missing params. Cache to localStorage
